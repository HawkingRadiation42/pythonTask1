# Python Task 1

This code uses a for loop to iterate over the students in list_1 and a list comprehension to find the corresponding student in list_2 (if it exists) based on the student ID. It then uses dictionary unpacking to merge the information from both dictionaries into a new dictionary and appends it to the merged_list.

Finally, the code adds any students from list_2 that are not already in the merged_list and returns the final merged_list
